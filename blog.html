            <h3>Question : Difference between Var and Let</h3>
            <h6>Answer : var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between
                them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped. Variable declared by let cannot be
                redeclared and must be declared before use whereas variables declared with var keyword are hoisted.</h6>

            <h3>Question : Difference between Arrow Function and Regular Function</h3>
            <h6>Answer : Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However,
                the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as
                constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword.</h6>

            <h3>Question : Difference between Map, forEach, Filter & Find</h3>
            <h6>Answer : All of these operates on Array.
                Map is used on all elements of an array and does the same operation for each elements and returns the
                result.
                forEach is used on all elements like map but unlike map it does not return anything.
                Filter is used on all the elements of an array but based on condition it returns all the elements that
                meets the condition.
                Find is used on all the elements of an array but unlike filter it only returns the first element that
                meet the condition.

                to create multiline strings and perform string interpolation. Template literals are the string literals
                and allow embedded expressions. Before ES6, template literals were called as template strings.
                Template string defined with `` backtick sign. It can dynamically load data.
